Poetry By Heart is a poetry recital competition for UK secondary school students. They wanted a clean, accessible, innovative website with a smooth experience. However, this project is more than just a website.
				
On top of building them a responsive web application, I designed and built a bespoke data structure to replace their outdated spreadsheet-based system. This allowed them to take charge of their competition registrations with multiple user access, reporting functionality, advanced filtering options and much more. What's more, it all integrates tightly with their CMS for maximum user-friendliness.
