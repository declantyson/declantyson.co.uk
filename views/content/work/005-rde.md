Originally a rebranding task for the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, the project expanded further when they merged with another local trust, Northern Devon Healthcare, to become the Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.

The project involved migration of content into a component-based CMS system and the development of a brand new careers microsite.
