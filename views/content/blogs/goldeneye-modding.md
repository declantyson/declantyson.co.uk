# Revisiting a Golden age

###### Modding classic N64 games brings nostalgia back to life

#### 18th May 2022

I've always been a big fan of mods of any type of game, but especially games I've already sunk hundreds of hours into. I've even dabbled in modding myself with _Civilization VI_ and _Rimworld_. _Project M_ was a love letter to the _Super Smash Bros._ series and I've played more _Pok√©mon_ rom hacks than I care to count. But one thing I for some reason had never even considered was my childhood favourite console - so my joy was immeasureable when I discovered that modding was alive and well for the Nintendo 64.

It all started simply because I had a hankering to play _Goldeneye_. What with having a one year old and an intense work schedule, my gaming time has whittled down to next to zero as of late save for two key times: 

1. Late at night, the last 30 minutes before bed
2. Taking a dump

And whilst my shitter game go-to has been _Football Manager_ for a long time I found myself not feeling up to starting a new save once I'd switched phone and it had lost my Ebbsfleet team that I had painstakingly dragged to the Championship on a shoestring budget and a squad of mostly regens. So, I decided to download an emulator and boot up the definitive, classic first person shooter.

Byt the time I had reached the Frigate level I found myself a little Nostalgia'd out. I'd found a great way to play the engine on a touchscreen (control scheme 1.3 is the best for this, if anyone's curious) but I'd just played these levels over and over and over. Then it struck me - has any smart person made more? So, to Google I went, and I found that not only were there more levels, but there were several entire campaigns. Wanting to stick to the 007 theme, I downloaded two campaigns: one based on _Goldfinger_ and one based on _Tomorrow Never Dies_.

The _Goldfinger 64_ mod rivals _Project M_ as one of the best, most comprehensive mods I've ever played. The base engine is the same, but everything else that could possibly be different is. Not only that but the attention to detail in terms of matching the film is quite something else - I watched the film over the course of my playthrough just for a bit of nostalgia and I found myself noticing random background elements in the film that had made its way into the scenery of the levels, such as the exact stable door design on Goldfinger's ranch, the tall diving board in the Miami hotel, and the Silo interior from the film's pre-title sequence. The objectives are sensible and well-thought out (although it's a shame that the base _Goldeneye_ engine doesn't allow for a more stealthy approach in some cases) and the story follows the film very closely, even filling in a couple of gaps with new levels that were left to be plot twists in the film. 

The one big criticism I have is that the levels are too large - like, far too large. There's a lot of getting lost looking for one small objective which can get very frustrating, especially as a lot of them take place in darkness. The worst offender for this is the Miami hotel where the opening swimming pool is about 3 times longer than it needs to be. Once you figure out the layout of these levels, though, speerunning them becomes quite fun and the target times set are again very well set so that they are challenging but not so difficult as to become impossible.

The _Tomorrow Never Dies_ mod does pale a bit in comparison but that's almost unfair to say. It checks the boxes of any good mod - the levels are brand new, and there's new music, guns and models just like _Goldfinger 64_ - but it has almost the opposite problem in that levels are criminally short. Like _Goldfinger 64_, _TND_ closely follows the events of the film directly but I think this is almost to its detriment - _TND_ as a movie has less sequences that make sense in this style of game, but the mod creators have had a decent attempt at converting them. The levels are actually on the whole better sized - they could do with being a bit bigger but really the more pressing problem is the linear objectives. It would be nice if they added some more in to follow the classic _Goldeneye_ level formula as _Goldfinger 64_ did but overall this is still a fun mod, even if it's not quite the incredibly full conversion that _Goldfinger 64_ is.

All this inspired me to go back and play _Perfect Dark_ - a game which I've played considerably less of - in fact, only the multiplayer. And as _Perfect Dark_ is basically just an upgraded _Goldeneye_ it's like I've got even more levels to play. 

It's always nice revisiting the classics, but it's even nicer when they've got a fresh coat of paint.
